<p><em>Friday 149 PM</em></p>

<p>Find myself on caltrain again. The bandages on my hands make typing more difficult. I think I&rsquo;ll take them off here, cause Matt said they should air out. met a cool circus dude on the ferry from san rafael to SF.</p>

<p>It was great catching a couple rainbows and balancing in the wind, an app Mile&rsquo;s had told us we were going 45 mph.</p>

<p>*Friday 340 PM *</p>

<p><em>Friday 602 PM</em></p>

<p>At the station. It was an interesting day. I feel many things. Had a nice meeting and got advice from Tom. We went over my Omari site and made some changes together. I need focus more than anything in my life right now. Today I realized I&rsquo;m spreading myself a little too thin.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_midi.html">https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_midi.html</a></p>

<p>^ If I was at noisebridge I&rsquo;d be working on getting the most basic MIDI messages to work with the teensy board.</p>

<p>But Tom set me off on a different path. My stress will lower if I&rsquo;m able to pay my way. It will at least be more manageable. I&rsquo;m tempted to smoke and drink, but I won&rsquo;t.  I need focus.</p>

<p>I just found out from him that the podcast will get a sponsor, but there&rsquo;s a very low chance that the money will trickle down to us. In short terms because it legally has to go to Stanford first. So working on the podcast isn&rsquo;t good for money, but it&rsquo;s great as a portfolio piece. And I love the team and the work. So I&rsquo;ll for sure continue to work on that. But I won&rsquo;t lie that my hopes were shattered with the incinuation that Beats by Dre would fund our show.</p>

<p>My favorite nugget from Tom (he&rsquo;s my producer mentor) was his advice to compile a list of 25 companies that I care about, and think I can help out. I&rsquo;m going to focus on that</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to send Ben and Noa a little thankyou plank, as well as Charles. I&rsquo;m going to formerly ask Ben to be my mentor or employment, whatever way I could help him out. The other item I&rsquo;m prepping towards meeting Stephan Crawford. Tom&rsquo;s known him for 20 years, and he&rsquo;ll be on a future innovators show. This is <a href="http://www.theclimatemusicproject.org/who-we-are/">Stephan&rsquo;s baby</a>, something I&rsquo;m very into.</p>

<p>Focus</p>
