<p>Song set in a meadow where I&rsquo;m walking, and asking a grasshopper I find for some life advice. I proceed to please my case. Grasshopper listens then gives me some generic advice response.</p>

<p>Game is to stick to this master / apprentice relationship with stuff. Keep it cool kung foo, karate kid, kill bill, etc&hellip;</p>

die in the next 18 minutes I
am old for my species gotta lot on my mind

only crickets will listen when humans leave us alone
but I digress I lament I repent my advice
not much but you’ll do fine

hop with your hips out
jump in the pull don’t walk now
you can’t make an omlete without breaking some eggs
honestly honesty best policy when going out
holding hands in public

ass is always leaner
when i around
Get you off that couch make your moma proud
