      <description>I dream in POLIWAT  Also my other account sound
I have been completely sober for 5 days Tuesday 952 PM
At Diridon in San Jose. Hopefully the 17 bus comes and I&amp;rsquo;ll get to my place in Santa Cruz before midnight. My laptop charging porter burned out while on the train so this is the last charge until I repair it. I found a shop in San Jose that has a new pot I can install myself for 40 bucks.</description>
