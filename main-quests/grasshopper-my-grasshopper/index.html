<p>Song set in a meadow where I&rsquo;m walking, and asking a grasshopper I find for some life advice. I proceed to please my case. Grasshopper listens then gives me some generic advice response.</p>

<p>Game is to stick to this master / apprentice relationship with stuff. Keep it cool kung foo, karate kid, kill bill, etc&hellip;</p>

[Verse 2]
The grasshopper said
michael my michael
I spit to you in desperation
these hard times I troubled
Why you fuck the earth my friend with confidence
my friend with eloquence
my friend with ignorance
my friend


don’t get stoned throw stones from your glass house (9)
you see life glass half empty though your Scotch full now (12)
everyone a mentor even myself
most are screwed
most are rude
cruel too


don't overthink
instead over do
what is life wihtout  
life's just a
just a
jump in the pool don't walk son


grasshopper

just a hop skip

dress up dress up dress up dress off

G said


i tasted her white lies
through red lips
off red wine

I need a mentor
I need a guru
I see right through you

most are censored
its absurd
that all are are mentors

spit to me friend


chorus
i need a mentor
i need a guru

-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-

none of your humans will ever hear you
die in obscurity
maybe the generation will look at you more clearly

no time to mentor cause I gotta hustle



her nudies worth a 1000 beers
get your ass in gear

you see life you see life glass half empty though yo martini a fullhouse

grasshopper he said
the early bird catches the worm you lost your way my friend
you see I live a shorter life
full of strife, I think I might
die in the next 18 minutes I
am old for my species gotta lot on my mind

only crickets will listen when humans leave us alone
but I digress I lament I repent my advice
not much but you’ll do fine

live hop with your hips out
jump in the pool don’t walk now
wax on wax off that couch make your moma proud


honestly honesty best policy when going out

can’t make an omlete without breaking some eggs

Get you off that couch make your moma proud



the grasshopper said hit upload every day
let me confess my actions not as intended
this tragic ad stupid
joint b4 analyze jenner in culture section

my go go gadget legs
my yolo ratchet ways
my tinder match it late
my tinder respond late

hopmonk cali



no go match it lays

Grasshopper oh grasshopper
I need a mentor
I need a guru
I need a mentor

hop fence sneak
apartment complex


pool swim just a hop jump and skip friend
why you rush to yoga class? (9)

tinder please cyber tease cybersex cyber please cyberflex
youtube comments

youtube famous
that straight depressing

Im an addicted to that carefree black girl magic1
