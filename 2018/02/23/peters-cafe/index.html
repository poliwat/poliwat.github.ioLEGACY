<p><strong>Friday 808 PM</strong></p>

<p>@ Peter&rsquo;s cafe right at the milbrae station. Got a ride from my new buddy Kiev to the North Berkeley BART, he got off at 16th and mission to hit the city with old college friends.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d rather pay 10 bucks and sit at this cafe while waiting the hour for the caltrain over taking a taxi, this is much nicer. Then I get to be on my laptop for both.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m real inspired to make some cool shit this week. It all begins with the move in. I need to move in and really kill the three places I&rsquo;m applying to this week. I haven&rsquo;t made a good log yet</p>

<p>If this waitress walks up again I&rsquo;ll get 6 silver dollar pancakes cause it&rsquo;s the biggest bang for my buck on the menu. I look forward to the days when you look at menus for the food items instead of the prices. I do that though.</p>

<p>Looks like Tom&rsquo;s grant funding is stalled yet again but I am undeterred, he will at least pay 50 bucks a session for being the recording engineer for the show the modern architect. So I&rsquo;m happy about htat, cause it basically pays for a free day at the station, which I love. However that would mean I&rsquo;m at the station like freaking thurs and monday, so I&rsquo;m going to try and switch my time to Friday nights I think. Friday or thursday nights.</p>

<p>I do need to eat but she&rsquo;s not coming up so it looks like I&rsquo;m ogin gto get hyped up off of coffee. That&rsquo;s fine though.</p>

<p>Alright I folded. Ordered the pancakces. My writing is off cause I&rsquo;ve been in paradise all week. I am not going to repeat a single kids name here out of respect for their identity. But I did give out my email to a few kids.</p>

<p>The primary job of Cabin Leader is to sleep in a cabin with 7 kids. You have to coherce them to sleep. A lof of the other campers play guitar, or tell a story. The kids love it, the cabin leaders are real popular for it.</p>

<p>I made up a game where we through a mattress on the ground, and then open the front door. Then we hosted a slide olympics where the kids run in from outside and jump on the mattress, attemptng to hit the heater on the other side of the room.</p>

<p>This one kid &lsquo;Ace&rsquo;</p>

<p>thta was giving me a hard time. He was an endearing combination of a pussy, a homophobe, and a dick all at once made me choke up at one point. We were about to go to sleep when he said &ldquo;</p>

<p>for steve seed,</p>

<h4 id="i-m-not-sure-at-what-point-yu-care">I&rsquo;m not sure at what point yu care</h4>

<p>&mdash;=-=-=-==&mdash;-</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of hours in the woods, making music in nature acoustic enviromnents.</p>

<p>This is the deal.</p>

<p>But if I had just 30 days where I could only work on this, then</p>

<p>Could you just give me 4,000 to start off, and I&rsquo;ll produce not only this project, but any other one.</p>

<p>Like I&rsquo;ll be your private little hacker da vinci,</p>

<p>if you need something specced out, I could write specs,</p>

<p>but if you have specs, then that&rsquo;s a task better suited for someone else. Cause I&rsquo;m all about creating from the new, or from scratch.</p>

<p>cominbing two already existing ideas in new cominations.</p>

<p>like yu gi oh or magic the gathering</p>

<p><strong>857 PM</strong></p>

<p>aannndd I find myself on caltrain yet again. Thank god I bought a ticket this time, it looks like I&rsquo;m about to get checked.</p>

<p>I miss camp already. It was so healing. That&rsquo;s my new addiction. It&rsquo;s okay cause I&rsquo;ll be building some cool new shit. Finishing poliwat and then debuting it this summer to practice with the kids at camp is definitely the goal now. I just need to make enough money to keep my housing and pay for school in order to finish my degree this spring. That&rsquo;s all I gotta do.</p>

<p>I will go all out on creating a beta for the poliwat suit.</p>
