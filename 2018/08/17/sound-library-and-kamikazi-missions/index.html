<p><strong>Fridat 207 PM</strong></p>

<p>This is a little disgusting. Just came to off the stuio floor at stanford. I put a chair in front of the door in case any came in, booked the room, and played the rough state of my poliwat album on repeat. Playing tag with the alarm. I just had to sleep.</p>

<p>But it sucks cause I need to get this sound library to Avery, and I just feel like it&rsquo;s not good enough, there&rsquo;s not enough to it. I&rsquo;m going to drop off what I did get done&hellip;. finally</p>

<p>Sitting by a fountain outside now, and there was a sick</p>

<p>uploading poliwat right now. I really need to fucking upload buttttttttttttttttttttttt</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to focus?</p>

<p>I really did a number on me. I need some lucy my brain is crying for it honestly. Sleep / pussy / and lucy</p>

<p>the 3 food groups === sleep pussy and lucy</p>

<p><strong>230 PM</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not feeling well I admit it. But I know this emotional state is temporary.</p>

<p>My fingers bleeding for some reason. I&rsquo;m running out of time. I can feel it. Everything&rsquo;s super hot right now - Cripsi is showing unprecendented love and support for poliw.at and other are as well. I need to stop fucking with the juul, only vape THC occasionally and fucking practice singing in the woods with my vest every fucking day !!!!!!!</p>

<p>just listening to my music on repeat. I can&rsquo;t upload it because poliw.at sound cloud is connected to my inactive email - I opened a ticket with them and hope to be back on soon. This is a little too much sometimes. I could really just use a lil R&amp;R, at my parents house lol.</p>

<p><strong>friday 402 pm</strong></p>

<p>no shame anymore in posting real shit on poliwat  -</p>

<p>tequila and I broke keto for a natty ice, so weak michael mode, on account of the need to dive through an external HDD named after my exGF, only way to do it in my book and fuck her</p>

update you won God
and also fuck you

I am at macdonalds
by myself and I ordered
enough for 3 people.

I hope you're happy, because
happiness is something I've come to not want to chase
cause happiness comes
as sadness goes  
and both are just as viable
means of existence.
I hope you're happy God,
while I am not
I hope the personification of you
attributing gender and temperment and personality
doesn't wear on you
and instead uplifts you
my humble creator
I hope you are happy God
because if you are happy while I am not
