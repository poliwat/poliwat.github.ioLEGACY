<p>About page for youtube, pale blue about page,</p>

<p>I’m 30,000 grand in debt for my college degree in Psychology. And that debt was worth what David Dunn has taught me, as a professor.</p>

<p>And it was in one of the more profound experiences in his life.</p>

<p>David dunn’s recount of his</p>

<p>Jerzy Grotkowski</p>

<p>and David Dunn applied to be his assistant.</p>

<p>and so he got in the top 10 by playing a bach conerto on the violin</p>

<p>training with  Jerzy Grotkowski.</p>

<p>the</p>

<p>physical intelligence required in order to do anything you want.</p>

<p>I want to improve human behavior.</p>

<p>Observational learning</p>

<p>Using science to create art,</p>

<p>Using the power of art, improve the behavior of our species, and not just improving our chances of survival, but setting the foreground for a thriving foundation, for the many derivations of homo sapiens that will arise from our infant information age.</p>

<p>“Observational learning is the cornerstone for our ability to change behavior,” said senior author Dr. Itzhak Fried, a professor of neurosurgery and psychiatry at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior. “It’s human nature to want to learn from other people’s mistakes rather than commit your own.”</p>

<p>The entire psychology department here at UCSC is a bad deal, and it’s only worth it if it’s real cheap or free. because it’s not an education. Psychology is a discipline that to many stem perspectives it’s in Jeopordy. But coming from the Psychology department at UCSC, I find that it is more of a young science. Where there’s a large seat at the table for ceativity because the studies are largely behavior based.</p>

<p>So what happens when you get two humans in a room?</p>

<p>and one human is starving and the other human has just eaten a village of Dennys</p>

<p>and they are told to ask each other if they are empathetic</p>

<p>is how a psychologist could think in that situation.</p>

<p>{{ie eye tracker study here}}
    that improves the behavior of all humans</p>

<pre><code>that alleviates human suffering
</code></pre>

<p>what do you want to do before you die?</p>

<p>I love asking this question!
think about it….</p>

<p>well my answer, this time
,</p>

<p>I imagine I could bounce my dick on her titties by eleven pm, fall asleep at her place, wake up with a glazed dougnut, get a glazed doughnut for the smile at ferrell’s by 10, then read Godel Escher bach on the bus to the waterfall for a session.</p>

<p>Poliw.at run ons till playoffs (a playoff is a point of signifiicance. it’s all significant. this is a point of significance.)</p>

<p>…sort of my answer to</p>

<p>what I want to do before I die</p>

<pre><code>how quickly humans forget

and when no communication

I haven't talked to this person in a while

let us take a moment and think of someone you haven't talked to in a while. You haven't hugged in a while. You know a hug is good for both of you, {{insert study on hugs as healers }}

all humans turn
they turn on themselves
and for no reason at all
and outside your control
some will turn on you
no matter how perfect your behavior
someone will turn on you

and so its best to design a support system
so when that happens, you'll make a swift recovery

I can't say why this is so,

but it is a notable phenomena of humanity.

and || they will  

no one in my life gives a fuck about http://poliw.at which is nice when I don't feel judged

All humans ween
All humans dance
