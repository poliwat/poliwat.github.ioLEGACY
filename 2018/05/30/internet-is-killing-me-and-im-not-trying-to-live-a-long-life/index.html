                    <p><strong>911 AM</strong></p>

<p>real prodcutive mornign and worked on the pale blue website stuff with hunter and cam till like 3 in the morning.</p>

<p>its ironic when the internet is fire speeds when the sun is shining bright then it gets shitty. but that was only yesterday, because it&rsquo;s completely now and it&rsquo;s a real sunny day. I fucking hate so much about everything when I can&rsquo;t connect to the fucking internet. I lost my phone and no one is home so I&rsquo;m completely off the GRID right now. Going to go work off the saw and record a session with just me and twisty.</p>

<p><strong>102 PM</strong></p>

<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to be complacent?</p>

<p>Am I complacent? complacency is easy to identify if you look at society at large,</p>

<p>but hard to see in ourselves and those around us</p>

<p>but we all have real complacent qualitities to us.</p>

<p>the act of finding out our complacent attributes, then case by case</p>

<p>there are many qualities that we have to live with ourselves, and its best to find out what we aren&rsquo;t changing and then move on to the stuff we do want to change.</p>

<p>do I have to live with this part of myself</p>

<p>do I live this with</p>

<p>so yeah if you don&rsquo;t want to be complacent, then what do you do with your time</p>

<p>there are many ways to grow</p>

<p>and one way that provides you with evidence of your growth</p>

<p>is this -</p>

<p>so idkk the question I want to ask myself</p>

<p>is what is the most advanced set of tasks only me myself and Irene can do?
||| |||</p>

<p>as an artist your job is to execute the most advanced set of tasks possible that only yourself can do in order to, over and over again.</p>

<p>well your job is everything so your job is also to execute the most simple of tasks, to the point that nothing actually occurred. that&rsquo;s another job of the artist.</p>

<p>I am complacent
there are complacent qualities to me
I would always love to play super smash all night with a ton of people.</p>

<p>whats the most advanced set of actions i can make</p>

<p><strong>Wed 445 PM</strong></p>

<pre><code>I'm not trying to live a long time

I'm living a full life

challenging myself as much as I possibly handle

because that's how

I dance with my own salvation

I dance with my pursuit of truth

I'm not trying to live a long time

I'm living a full life
