<p><strong>Monday 140  PM</strong></p>

<p>I woke around 10 AM. Been soldering for poliwat at my desk, it feels good to get back on it but it&rsquo;s seriously been so long that moral is low. I should soldered this shit months ago. I shouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;ve gotten so high so often. But that&rsquo;s what trap inspires. trap gods are powered by cannibis. It&rsquo;s cannibus inspired music.</p>

<p>This week will see good poliwat logs cause I&rsquo;m entering the hermit zone. The only thing(s) holding me back is shitty internet and low impulse control.</p>

<p>Often If pages don&rsquo;t load fast enough, I forget what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>

<p>Moral is also a little low right now for a few reasons.</p>

<p>The makerspace is coming along nicely. Hunter and I have been going ham on discord and we had a bunch of fun making plans last night. But sadly we are losing the car port,</p>

<p>Gwen the wonderful artist</p>

<p><strong>tuesday 253 AM</strong></p>

<p>peter pan has just begun on the vcr. Thanks for the keyboard cam it&rsquo;s coming in clutch right now.</p>

<p>I just sang for a long time and worked on I am a spliff grasshopper my grasshopper, reverse.</p>

<p>|| ||| ahahaha talking to Tiffani she read poliwat!!! | | | | |</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on lock down</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m freaking out</p>

<p>Im so stressed</p>

<p>Blah blah blah</p>

<p>I just stared into the mirror and bounced my erect torso and body looking in the mirror.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t tell people about poliw.at</p>

<p>Ahahaha I remember when I said that to Stefan as a joke and he was like OKAY
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=</p>

<p>I had some good thoughts to share but they left me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s because I took too long to get to the laptop. I smoked all the &lsquo;infinity spliff&rsquo; jar as we called it two nights ago.</p>

<p>should I talk about myself</p>

<p>or poliwat</p>

<p>or pale blue dot</p>

<p>or my love life</p>

<p>or fuck you future michael</p>

<p>stop getting so high that you don&rsquo;t document the gems of the day</p>

<p>weak game this week</p>

<p>Go the fuck to sleep, make coffee take a hot shower and wake up and hit it hard and</p>

<p>OH I REMEMBER NOW</p>

<p>I noticed in my behavior, my impulse control has weakened. Dramatically. Impulse is instrumental in music making.</p>

<p>-====-=-=-=&ndash;=-
I am broken</p>

<p>but its temprary cause I&rsquo;ve been here before</p>

<p>and that&rsquo;s what you do</p>

<p>you contort and change your body</p>

<p>over the course of months or weeks</p>

<p>a bunch of small roles</p>

<p>are developing</p>

<p>the cycle of infinite characters</p>

<p>lives opinions and stories</p>

<p>Help me my phone has been out since idk Saturday and I don&rsquo;t have enough money for it.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m not only terrible with money, I&rsquo;m terrible with talking about money. And the better my art gets, the worse the money stuff gets. But it&rsquo;s actually looking pretty good because I have a lot of projects that are growing (organically)</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t talk to anyone. Everyone is distracting me and I am disctracting myself.  vc</p>
