                    <p><strong>Sunday 803 PM</strong></p>

<p>My granny&rsquo;s hometown. I can&rsquo;t wait to go there.</p>

<p>I walked home in about an hour and 30 from campus, listening to tape from yesterday and reading 12 rules for life.</p>

<p>The only reason I have jordan peterson&rsquo;s book is because Bean happened to have it and she brought it over. Cas Katie Celia Simone came over at 9 with a live chicken and we took it to the chapel. I watched Katie kill it with her bare hands, it was the first chicken she&rsquo;s killed. She practiced the manuver we googled on my hand, and it hurt. You can&rsquo;t really get out of it. During that moment of silence when Katie as about to kill the chicken, I wanted to scream STOP like the end wedding scene in <em>The Graduate</em>. But I didn&rsquo;t because I wanted to see if she would actually kill it. How many humans / creatures have died because no one in the group said anything, because they wanted to see if the killer would kill?
  After she cut the chicken&rsquo;s head off with my buck knife, I put it on a nice random page in Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s book.</p>

<p>Today is the day I submit to Jordan Peterson. And I do this becasue this last month has been bad. I know I&rsquo;m cosmically behind schedule.</p>

<p>This last trip trip with lucy hunter lupe koa max and bridget was real educational. But I failed in many zones, and don&rsquo;t have much good audio.</p>

<p>But what I do have, is the new direction.</p>

<p>It is here and now that I submit myself to rehab. I will finish my behavior manual for myself and a workable version of poliwat - then hit the road and be a modern day ronin or sorts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the road to becoming a master</p>

<p>The journeyman is called a journeyman because they live in the journey. If we imagine life as a sacred circle, then the journey is a method to traverse circles over a period of time. This is where the journeyman is on the road to becoming a master.</p>

<p>Where am I</p>

<p>Who am I</p>

<p>Why am I</p>

<p>When am I</p>

<p>What am I</p>

<p>is this a free statue
  could I steal it?
  if I can lift it?
  my ex dumped me before I got excalibur
  now</p>

<p>pay off audio debt</p>

<p>and then wayyyyy down the line - pay off actual debt with art</p>

<p>I feel focused.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m all about using science to make art towards improving humanity. Using that science to make art</p>
