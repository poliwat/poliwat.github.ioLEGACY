<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Michael Betts!</p>

<p>Now a few months ago I was possibly going to be working on a web app for ya&rsquo;ll at the third wave.</p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t pay quit enough.</p>

<p>Things have changed Now</p>

<p>Because the sulbties of microdosing have changed me profoundly.</p>

<p>In private, I attribute microdosing with philosybin and LSD to the cause of a few things</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m producing and acting in a play, a comedy based off the video game the Sims,</p>

<p>where we act like sims and are well dealing with simulation theory.</p>

<p>which is sort of a common theme in LSD</p>

<p>I have some absolutelt insane stories of microdosing revelations, but that&rsquo;s for another time.</p>

<p>For this position,</p>

<p>microdosing inspired some of the latest projects I&rsquo;ve been working on,</p>

<p>including but not limited to:</p>

<p>A late night show at stanford college radio, called Pale Blue Dawt.</p>

<p>Pale Blue Dawt is a radio show, based off a nonprofit I started.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fiscally sponsored by the social good</p>

<p>and in all the work for the rest of my life,</p>

<p>I want to stay true to our mission statement.</p>

<p>I have a lot of awesome friends in silicon valley, which has a great culture and community for the responsible use of psychedelics.</p>

<p>on a personal note,
I view psychedelics as a medicine, that defeated my depression.</p>

<p>With or without me, I hope to see the third wave grow. I&rsquo;d love to schedule Paul Austin or anyone else in the organizaiton for a skype interview so we can broadcast the third wave&rsquo;s message to stanford&rsquo;s community.</p>

<p>It would be awesome to work with ya&rsquo;ll!</p>

<p>I quit coding professionally because it wasn&rsquo;t good for my health. I&rsquo;m not really built for it. And psychedelics taught me that. I like to think of micordosing as sort of a fast track for learning, if you really work hard.</p>

<p>I think psychedelics help put you above the curve, help make you more competitive,
and attractive in this world.</p>

<p>I think psychedelics helps foster choosing your own path.</p>

<p>micordosing inspired me to write a book, entitled love is capital, which is a candid guidebook for navigating archtypal relationships.</p>

<p>I hope maybe now, we can work together.</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan of the third wave for a long time, and have the skills necessary, for being a strong representative of the communtiy of drugs.</p>

<p>I think we need more industrious hippies (laugh), in order to cultivate a culture of microdosing, to everyone&rsquo;s benefit.</p>

<p>I like the idea of being an industrious hippy.</p>

<p>If you would like any help at all, if you find me useful,
I&rsquo;d love to really join the team.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for watching! Look at that VIEW!</p>
