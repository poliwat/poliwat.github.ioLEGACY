<p>I&rsquo;m going to try something new. Instead of getting high, I will do something new.
Looking over the past month I&rsquo;ve taken the time to regulate substances, and have been made noticeable improvement. I have now made it about 5 days since my last tobacco hit and so I may be in the clear. It&rsquo;s been hard at times being around many friends with countless substance opportunities.</p>

<p>I think I shared this before, but I will say it again because I there&rsquo;s more to say -
Peter&rsquo;s writing friend described writing as getting ass raped by God. Some people like getting ass raped by God. I don&rsquo;t remember now what else I was going to say because the ass rape came as too surprising.</p>

<p>Just called the DJ company, Jack. I&rsquo;m heading to SC today.</p>

<p>Looking at grad programs. I decided I need to be in Europe for grad school. Also no one is stopping me from making videos now.</p>

<p>My only salvation is writing. Sometimes my only salvation is concentrating on breath.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really inbetween right now. It&rsquo;s <strong>10 19 AM</strong>, I was originally planning on going to Santa Cruz, but the DJ guy hasn&rsquo;t called back yet. Also I need to work uber delivery, and for SF it&rsquo;ll be most profitable. I will use Jack&rsquo;s bike.</p>

<p>I like the idea of increasing my industriusness. An industry-minded hippie.
Industrious hippie. Been listening to Jordan Peterson for hours each day. I keep failing to hit people back up, that&rsquo;s another note. I&rsquo;ll just keep writing. Writing until I can no longer write. I don&rsquo;t need to edit on poliwat - that&rsquo;s not required in the terms and conditions.</p>

<p>Listening to Milo trying to figure out what to do next - and working uber EATS is probably the best idea. Yesterday I cleaned my room and realized I left my pedalboard I was trying to sell and my SM7b microphone back home.</p>

<p>Setting up the studio felt good, wherever I end up these are the options -</p>

<p>situational analysis of my life -</p>

<p>5 weeks until the play. It&rsquo;s going to go real fast. April 22 is Earth Day.</p>
