                    <p><strong>Monday 1159 AM</strong></p>

<p>On the stage at my new house. The last 48 hours was insane! I spent 101 buck at grocery outlet, and have been at my house all weekend. Spent from dawn to the time I passed on music yesterday. Made about 30 minutes of radio. Pretty fast pace, my workflow has gotten much faster.</p>

<p>however the inner junky in me won, and I day drank smoked and did some extra credit drugs as well. It felt great, but I need to get my shit together - I have 5 days I can work here until Steven comes and I go to camp.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t get service out here and just popped a halfy,
you know, half truth</p>

<pre><code>Monday: finalize shot list + monoglogue I'm to do from high up in a tree.

Monday night: radio show with Darlene. { 2 hours + of public transit today :) } That's why a halfy is a good choice.

Thurs: recording modern arhcitect with tom for 50 bucks
Friday: meeting ben glass in SF for a good chocolate consultation meeting
Friday: going in to work on the innovators with avery and tom
Sat: filing with Celia and Katie
</code></pre>

<pre><code>I say more when I say less
</code></pre>

<p>Last night I hung out with James, OMG so good to see him and shoot the shit for a while. We had some Rossi + Budweisser, and had some real epic jams with niko. So good. Can&rsquo;t wait to hear the tape.</p>

<p>Listening to JL now, James put a setlist together and we greenlit doing the whole thing. I am real excited about Jimmothy Leary again, and I&rsquo;m going to make it a priority. We will do our first show hopefully in the Spring.
I just really believe in Jimmothy Leary.
Right now the lineup is James and I, he&rsquo;ll do guitar and sound effects, and I&rsquo;ll do synths and vocals. I&rsquo;m honored he wanted me on vocals so I&rsquo;m going to keep practicing!</p>

<p>Maybe a halfy was a little strong :D I go a bunch of audio work to do though so it&rsquo;ll work out.</p>

<p>What else?</p>

<p>So I can start a nonprofit, that&rsquo;ll be paleblue.fm, which will be a 501&copy; organization. Then Pale Blue will also be a client to my production company I&rsquo;m starting with Avery. We&rsquo;re talking to a lawyer now named Michelle, and we are writing up our agreement for going 50 50 on it all. Avery is the perfect business partner and friend. I love that dude. There&rsquo;s no one else I&rsquo;ve ever met that&rsquo;s so on the same page as me, about the world and what to make of our precious time here. And it is precious.</p>

<p>Today is a serious day of revelation.
The first is routine. I&rsquo;m about to be at camp with kids for 2 weeks, which will be the time to set healthy habits.</p>

<p>I applied for that music director thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m v worried about how I&rsquo;m going to cover rent, but we&rsquo;ll just take it month by month. If the LLC can be finalized by April 2nd, then we can go all out on producing podcasts for people.</p>

<p>I love being out here on this stage. I&rsquo;m a click away from buying a VR camera.</p>

<p><strong>Monday 1228 PM</strong></p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;m paying off my audio debt</p>
